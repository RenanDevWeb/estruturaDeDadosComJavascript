## üìÇ Contents

The repository includes the following data structures and algorithms:

- **Stacks (`pilha`)**: Implementation of stack data structure following LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- **Queues (`filas`)**: Implementation of queue data structure following FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- **Linked Lists (`listaLigada`)**: Implementation of singly linked list data structure.
- **Algorithms (`algoritmos`)**: Various algorithm implementations, including:
  - **Decimal to Binary Conversion (`decimalToBinarie`)**: Function to convert decimal numbers to their binary representation.
